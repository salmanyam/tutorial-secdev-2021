  + New documentation:

     doc/howto/Regex.html

1.3.0rc2
---------

  + Bugfixes:

    sean <infamous42md at hotpop.com> found two format string vulnerabilities,
    one in mod_sql's SQLShowInfo directive, and one involving the 'ftpshut'
    utility.  Both can be considered low risk, as they require active
    involvement on the part of the site administrator in order to be
    exploited:

      Using 'ftpshut', the administrator has the ability to configure a
      shutdown message, which will be displayed to connecting clients.  This
      message can make use of several variables.  *If* a variable such as
      %C (current working directory) is used in that shutdown message, and
      an attacker is aware of this, the attacker can create a directory using
      an FTP client, and give the directory a name such that the %C variable
      discloses information that should not be available (i.e. contents of
      data in nearby buffers).  To prevent this scenario, administrators
      who use 'ftpshut' should avoid using the %C, %R, and %U variables.

      If the configuration uses the SQLShowInfo directive provided by
      mod_sql.  This directive can be used to add information from the SQL
      tables to response messages sent to the client.  If misconfigured by the
      site administrator (by using data from tables into which a user
      can insert arbitrary strings), data pulled from the SQL tables could be
      used in such a way as to attempt to use a malicious format string in
      the returned message.  To prevent this, do not use SQLShowInfo.

    Both vulnerabilities are fixed in this 1.3.0rc2 release.

  + Module enhancements:

     mod_ctrls_admin
       New 'dns' control action, for setting UseReverseDNS configuration
       at runtime.

     mod_delay
       Many improvements made to improve stability.

     mod_sql_mysql
       The mod_sql_mysql module now handles the old MySQL password format
       more gracefully.  Starting with MySQL 4.1.1, the format for passwords
       stored using the MySQL PASSWORD() function changed.  This format change
       causes issues for sites that have passwords stored in the older format.
       Sites that run mod_sql+mod_sql_mysql would see this as users being
       unable to login.  Now, if compiled against MySQL 4.1.1 or later,
       mod_sql_mysql will first check the password using the current MySQL
       format; if that fails it will fall back to checking the old format.
       Note that this only affects sites which have the "Backend" type in
       their SQLAuthTypes directive.

  + New documentation:

     doc/howto/DNS.html
     doc/howto/VirtualUsers.html


1.3.0rc1
---------
  + New configuration directives:

      MaxConnectionsPerHost
        Similar to MaxClientsPerHost, the administrator can configure
        the maximum number of connected clients from a single host at
        one time.  Unlike MaxClientsPerHost, though, the
        MaxConnectionsPerHost limit is evaluated prior to authentication,
        i.e. before the client has sent any USER and PASS commands.

      SQLBackend
        mod_sql now supports a SQLBackend configuration directive, for
        selecting the specific database backend module to use on a per-vhost
        basis.  Previously, mod_sql could only be compiled with one
        backend module at a time; the module has been enhanced to support
        multiple backend modules.  Since multiple backends are now
        possible, SQLBackend was added so that the administrator could
        specify which to use.  If only one backend module is used,
        e.g. mod_sql_mysql, then that backend is used by default, and
        no SQLBackend directive is required.

      SQLEngine
        mod_sql supports a new SQLEngine directive.  This directive can
        be used to configure mod_sql to only be used for authentication,
        or only for logging, or for both.  It is also used to create
        an <Anonymous> section that does not use mod_sql for lookups,
        but still have mod_sql used for non-anonymous users.

      UseSendfile
        ProFTPD now automatically checks for sendfile support, and uses
        it if present.  The UseSendfile directive can be used to configure
        proftpd not to use the sendfile() function if necessary.

        Note that if sendfile support is enabled, tools like ftpwho and
        ftptop will not show the transfer rate for downloads.  These tools
        work by reading the scoreboard, and the scoreboard is updated
        periodically during uploads and downloads.  However, when
        sendfile() is used, the scoreboard does not have a chance to be
        updated.  This is only true for downloads; the tools will continue
        to show the transfer rate for uploads.

  + Enhanced configuration directives:

      ExtendedLog
        There is a new logging class, SEC (short for "SECURE").
        This logging class captures RFC2228-related security FTP commands.

      ListOptions
        The -S list option, for listing files sorted by file size, has
        been added.

  + New command-line options:
      The new -V and --settings command-line options display various
      compile-time settings of the compiled proftpd binary.

  + New configure options:

      --enable-dso
        This configure option enables DSO support in the compiled proftpd,
        and causes the mod_dso module to be compiled in.  See the
        README.DSO and doc/howto/DSO.html files for details.
 
      --enable-facl
        This configuration option enables support for POSIX ACLs, on
        systems that support them, in the compiled proftpd.  See the
        README.facl file for more information.

  + New modules:

      mod_delay
        There is the possibility of a timing attack on proftpd, leading
        to discovery of valid user names (Bug #2480).  This module was
        added to mitigate this timing attack; see doc/modules/mod_delay.html
        for more information.

      mod_dso
        This module handles the dynamic loading and unloading of shared
        modules from the running proftpd server.  Note that this module
        requires the --enable-dso configure option to be used when compiling
        proftpd.  See README.DSO for more information on shared modules.
        The doc/modules/mod_dso.html file contains documentation for this
        module.

      mod_facl
        This module uses the FSIO API to provide checking of file
        permissions that use POSIX ACLs.  The --enable-facl configure
        option must be used when compiling proftpd for this module to
        be used.  See the README.facl file for more information.

      mod_load
        This module provides the ability to deny a connection if the
        system load is above a configurable limit; useful for imposing
        resource restrictions.  The doc/contrib/mod_load.html file
        contains documentation for this module.

  + Enhanced modules:

      mod_ldap
        The mod_ldap module has been updated to version 2.8.15.

      mod_quotatab
        The mod_quotatab module now supports enforcing hard limits at
        the filesystem level.  This means that if the quota limit is
        a hard limit, and a client exceeds that limit, the upload
        will fail.  Previously, the upload would succeed, but the file
        would be automatically deleted.

      mod_tls
        The mod_tls module now supports the CCC FTP command, which can
        be used by FTPS clients to secure data transfers with FTPS
        servers in a firewalled environment.

  + New Display variables:

      %{total_bytes_in}
      %{total_bytes_out}
      %{total_bytes_xfer}
      %{total_files_in}
      %{total_files_out}
      %{total_files_xfer}
        These new Display variables use the new variable syntax;
        see doc/howto/DisplayFiles.html for details.

  + Deprecated configuration directives:

      Bind
        The Bind directive was causing too much confusion, and did not
        do as many system administrators assumed it.  Rather than using
        Bind to associate a server configuration with an IP address,
        administrators would assume it was meant for making ProFTPD
        bind to a single address.

        Rather than having a configuration like this:

          <VirtualHost host1.domain.com>
            Bind host2.domain.com
            ...
          </VirtualHost>

        The <VirtualHost> and DefaultAddress directives can now handle
        multiple addresses, so that the above configuration becomes:

          <VirtualHost host1.domain.com host2.domain.com>
            ...
          </VirtualHost>
