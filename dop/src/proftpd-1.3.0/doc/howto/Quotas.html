<p>
A busy FTP server handles hundreds to thousands of files belonging to hundreds
to thousands of users.  There is not an infinite capacity on the disks of
the server, however, and eventually those files will take up too much space.
Thus many sites have a pressing need to set limits on just how much can
be stored on the server by their users.

<p>
Most Unix systems have support for OS- or fileystem-level quotas.  These
have the advantage of being transparent to applications like
<code>proftpd</code>, which means that the applications need not worry
about maintaining and enforcing quotas.  The kernel/filesystem will handle
that.  One disadvantage these OS-level quotas have, though, is that they
are strictly tied to OS and/or filesystem, and not all Unix kernels and
filesystems are the same.  They also rely on each user having their own
separate user ID.  In the case of
<a href="VirtualUsers.html">virtual users</a> for <code>proftpd</code>, it is
possible for many users to have the same user ID, which causes problems for
these traditional Unix quotas.

<p>
For these reasons, the <a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab.html"><code>mod_quotatab</code></a> module was developed for ProFTPD.  This module, being part of the
application, applies to all the Unix kernels and filesystems which support
ProFTPD, and easily handles virtual users.  The <code>mod_quotatab</code>
documentation covers how to configure <code>proftpd</code> for quotas.

<p>
<b>Note</b>: This howto is a work-in-progress.  Please contact me with
suggestions, questions, requests, <i>etc</i> for what you would like to see
covered here.  Thanks!

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>

<p><a name="QuotasDiskSpace" title="#QuotasDiskSpace"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How do I set the disk space limit for a user?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The short answer is to use the &quot;upload bytes limit&quot; setting.

<p>
It's true that the various limits maintained by <code>mod_quotatab</code>,
for either bytes or files (or both), are confusing.  When designing
the module, I anticipated administrators wanting to limit download as well
as upload transfers; in reality, most administrators wish to limit the
disk space for their users.  The bytes uploaded limit doubles as the
disk space limit, for there is no effective difference between them; any
bytes uploaded via FTP are automatically stored on disk.

<p><a name="QuotasExternalChanges" title="#QuotasExternalChanges"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: <code>mod_quotatab</code> only tracks changes
made using <code>proftpd</code>, and my users can add/remove files other ways.
What am I supposed to do?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: As the <code>mod_quotatab</code> documentation
states, the module was designed only to track changes done via FTP; it
made implementation of quotas simpler.

<p>
This question is also often posed as "Why can't mod_quotatab just calculate
the amount of space used by a user?"  The module <i>could</i> do this,
but there are some considerations with this kind of approach.

<p>
The primary consideration is the time cost of having to recurse a directory.
If the directory is relatively small, the time needed is small.  For very
large/deep directories, however, the time needed to do the scan could be
long, possibly long enough for users to notice and complain.  Another
complication is the disk space used by a given user is not confined to
their home directory.  Many sites have home directories for users, and
have a shared directory that all users can use.  Somehow
<code>mod_quotatab</code> would need to know to scan these shared directories.

<p>
This feature has been requested enough, though, that I am planning on
adding the capability to <code>mod_quotatab</code> at some point in the
future, as it is clearly useful for administrators.

<p><a name="QuotasInitialization" title="#QuotasInitialization"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: If <code>mod_quotatab</code> does not
automatically scan for disk space usage, how will it know about my existing
users?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: By default, <code>mod_quotatab</code>
indeed knows nothing about what disk space is already occupied by your
users; the tally table starts out blank.

<p>
To help address this, there is a <code>diskuse.pl</code> Perl script:
<pre>
  <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/contrib/diskuse">http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/contrib/diskuse</a>
</pre>
which will display the number of bytes owned by a given user (or group) within
a list of directories.  The parameters needed for running
<code>diskuse.pl</code> are documented
<a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/contrib/diskuse.html">here</a>.

<p>
Once you've run <code>diskuse.pl</code> to find out the current usage for
your users, you can enter those numbers into your tally table.  Unfortunately
<code>diskuse.pl</code> cannot read your <code>proftpd.conf</code> file
to know whether you are using a file- or SQL-based tally table, so it cannot
automatically update your tally table.

<p><a name="QuotasDefaults" title="#QuotasDefaults"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How can I set a default quota for all of my users?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Unfortunately, there is no way currently
to do this.  The <code>mod_quotatab</code> module was designed such that
the administrator would have to explicitly create limits for every user.

<p>
However, a <code>mod_quotatab_default</code> module could be written to
provide default quotas.  I simply do not know if this would be desirable
enough to users for writing the module.

<p><a name="QuotasTallyTable" title="#QuotasTallyTable"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: What is a &quot;tally table&quot;?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Tally tables, and limit tables, are
covered in the <code>mod_quotatab</code> <a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab.html#QuotaTables">documentation</a>.

<p><a name="QuotasCreatingFileTables" title="#QuotasCreatingFileTables"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How do I construct the limit and tally files for file-based quotas?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: There is a Perl script called <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/contrib/ftpquota.html"><code>ftpquota</code></a> which
can create the necessary files.  This script can also be found under the
<code>contrib/</code> directory of the <code>proftpd</code> source
distribution.

<p><a name="QuotasCreatingSQLTables" title="#QuotasCreatingSQLTables"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Is there a SQL script for the SQL quota tables used by <code>mod_quotatab_sql</code>?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: No.  However, the <code>mod_quotatab_sql</code>
<a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab_sql.html">documentation</a> contains example schema for the necessary tables.

<p><a name="QuotasDirectorySize" title="#QuotasDirectorySize"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How do I set a limit on the size of a
directory?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Currently, you cannot.

<p>
Traditional Unix quotas are implemented in terms of <i>ownership</i>: the
thing that counts is not where a file is located on the filesystem, but
which user and/or group owns the file.  Asking about directory quotas
assumes a different basis for quotas, based on <i>location</i> rather than
ownership (such quotas are often called <i>tree-based quotas</i>).  The
<code>mod_quotatab</code> module followed the example of traditional Unix
quotas, but I have started designing how location-based quotas might be
implemented.

<p><a name="QuotasNotUpdating" title="#QuotasNotUpdating"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why isn't <code>mod_quotatab</code> updating my tally table?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: It depends.

<p>
One possibility is that the <em>per session</em> flag in the limit in
effect is set to <code>true</code>, which means that the limits will only
be applied to this session.  When this happens, <code>mod_quotatab</code>
will not update the tally table.

<p>
If this is not the case, then consider looking in the <a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab.html#QuotaLog"><code>QuotaLog</code></a> file for more information.

<p><a name="QuotasPerMonth" title="#QuotasPerMonth></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Can I use <code>mod_quotatab</code> to set
monthly quotas?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Sort of.  <code>mod_quotatab</code> itself
has no concept of time, so this sort of capability is not built-in.  However,
it can be approximated by having some other process, such as a cron job,
periodically (such as once a month) clear the tally table, yielding the
effect of monthly quotas.

<p><a name="QuotasDisplay" title="#QuotasDisplay"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How can users see their current quota?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: There are two ways to show the current quota
to users.  There is the <a href="../contrib//mod_quotatab.html#SITE_QUOTA"><code>SITE QUOTA</code></a> command.  And there are
certain <a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab.html#QuotaDisplay"><code>Display</code></a> variables that are supported by the
<code>mod_quotatab</code> module.

<p><a name="QuotasPerFile" title="#QuotasPerFile"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: What if I want to set limits on the size of
individual files being transferred?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: For this, you do not need the
<code>mod_quotatab</code> module.  ProFTPD has the
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_MaxRetrieveFileSize.html"><code>MaxRetrieveFileSize</code></a> and
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_MaxStoreFileSize.html"><code>MaxStoreFileSize</code></a> directives.

<p><a name="QuotasUnsupportedType" title="#QuotasUnsupportedType"></a>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why do I see the following error?
<pre>
  QuotaLimitTable: unsupported table source type: 'sql'
</pre>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The <code>mod_quotatab</code> module acts
as a general quota managing front-end; it relies on other backend modules
to handle the specifics of storage formats.  Every backend module
(<i>e.g.</i>
<a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab_file.html"><code>mod_quotatab_file</code></a>, <a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab_sql.html"><code>mod_quotatab_sql</code></a>, <a href="../contrib/mod_quotatab_ldap.html"><code>mod_quotatab_ldap</code></a>) registers a supported <em>table type</em> with the main
<code>mod_quotatab</code> module.  The error above indicates that the
<code>mod_quotatab_sql</code> module has not been compiled/loaded into
<code>proftpd</code>.
